misc code and stuff

`pdf_renamer`: automatically extract the title from a PDF file (special case when working with files from ACL Anthology)

`Madamira-Arapy`: forked from https://github.com/jordanking/arapy added compatibility with python 3.6+ and some new functions to return morphological attributes (only fixed the Madamira files)
